# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

* pwr: Add backup domain voltage regulator control [#303][303]
* MSRV increased to 1.56.1

## [v0.11.0] 2021-12-18

* **Breaking**: Simplified API for reading device signature
  values. `VAL::get().read()` becomes `VAL::read()`
* **Breaking**: SAI `sai_[ab]_ker_ck` methods now return `Hertz` rather than
  `Option<Hertz>` and if the clock is stopped they panic with a message.
* **Breaking**: Rename the `quadspi` flag to `xspi`
* **Breaking**: serial: manual control over data length removed, now set automatically based on parity [#297][297]
* Upgrade to cortex-m-rt v0.7.0 [#257][257] [#264][264]
* **Breaking**: If you use RTIC v0.5, you need to depend on it with
  `default-features = false, features = ["cortex-m-7"]`. See
  [rtic-rs/cortex-m-rtic#509](https://github.com/rtic-rs/cortex-m-rtic/pull/509)
* Add support for OCTOSPI on supported parts, also using the `xspi` feature flag [#230][230]
* Add support for STM32H735 (feature flag `stm32h735` [#235][235]
* Rename the PeripheralREC object for BDMA2 on 7B3, 7B0, 7A3 parts from BDMA to BDMA2

  constants to specify how many transmit / receive buffers to include in
  `ethernet::DesRing`. To replicate the previous behaviour, use `DesRing<4, 4>` [#247][247]

## [v0.9.0] 2021-03-12

* Updates `cortex-m` to v0.7.1. `cortex-m` v0.6.5+ [are forward compatible with
  v0.7.0+][cm6-changelog] except for CBP, ITM, MPU, NVIC, SCB. If you have
  problems, run `cargo update` to try to switch to `cortex-m` v0.7 in other
  dependencies. Something like `cargo tree` is very useful to track down
  remaining uses of `cortex-m` v0.6.

  types from structure
